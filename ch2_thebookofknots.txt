2.  The Book of Knots:  Duchamp in the Mirror

	I'll bet a monkey can't invent a knot.  If they could, they would tie the whole 	jungle up in knots.  What would the behaviorists say?  Mind saw the knot; 		monkey did not.
								—R. Buckminster Fuller

	In 1942 at the First Papers of Surrealism exhibition in New York, Marcel Duchamp installed a work entitled 16 Miles of String, “of which of which only about one mile was used, to prepare an entanglement […].”
	The preview evening was invitational, distingué, and dressy. First the arriving 	guests were confronted by the string jungle. Then their ears were assailed by 	the happy shouts of children at play. The whole ballroom, in fact, looked like a 	public playground. 
The above had been intentionally scripted by Duchamp, and
	The guests had no choice but to pick their perilous way through this juvenile 	Olympiad. A half-dozen boys were vigorously and lightheartedly playing a sort 	of combination game with various types of balls. They wore football helmets, 	baseball pants, basketball sneakers, and gym shirts. A like number of girls 		were in little groups, skipping rope, playing jacks and hopscotch. Some 		foolhardy guests tried admonishing the children: "Why don't you, litle dears, 	go out in the street and play, where you belong?" "Mr. Duchamp told us we 	could play here," was the invariable answer. Mr. Duchamp, of course, could 	not be found. Having arranged the show, his final Dada gesture was not to 	attend.
Perhaps because he could already anticipate the outcome.
	From the above epigraph, Fuller concurs that intentionality of “the roped knot represents a long-lasting memorandum of the abstract, weightless minds' weightless conceptioning in pure principle.”  He’s referring to the over/under conceptualization of how a knot is tied, and the mind’s ability to formulate the instructions one might find in a Complete Encyclopedia of Knots or similar publication. On the other hand, Duchamp’s conceptual delight was to make a knot for the knot’s sake, to know that art was a provocation.  His checkmate positioning between action and “non-retinal” perception follow the course of algorithmic scripting, even if the disentanglement played through a series of private puns.
	This chapter will trace forward and back from the Duchampian knot, initiated by the Salon des Refuses as noted by Theirry de Duve, and asking where—at the outer threshold between performance and real life, does the entanglement cease?  If de Duve’s question, posed to ask “is this art?” can be answered, the performative gestures must intersect and loop back from a peripheral audience.  Both conceptual loop and performative knots are often a calculated transgression—artists including John Duncan and Lee Lozano will be discussed in terms of a Duchampian legacy.  Most importantly audience will be identified as the critical juncture, judge and jury, insuring not only the formal propagation, but also its perpetuation.
