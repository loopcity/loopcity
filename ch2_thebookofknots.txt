1. Loop City:  An Introduction

When Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel operating system, he didn’t anticipate having to manage thousands of contributions the open source software.  To quote, “Git is my second big project, created only for me to maintain my first big project.”  Versioning software is one way to keep loops from becoming knots—it manages a history of changes on a linear timeline.  Take for example when you modify an image in Photoshop, you save the entire image—flattened or layered—not just the airbrushed gesture.  

Versioning software on the other hand, and Torvalds’ GitHub in particular, archives the layer of airbrushed touch-ups alone, and compares modifications to the previous version side by side, like toggling undo/redo through your Photoshop history.  Git also manages parallel timelines of branching histories.  So basically if your impatient editor wants to breath down the neck of your workflow, he doesn’t have to download entire RAW files, but could rather just call Git and pull an update.  GitHub takes that shared loop, like a melody held just in mind, and tweaks the notes one by one.  It’s rather like a symphony of Cory Arcangel cat videos, with distributed users each hitting a single key.

Git collates the accumulated loop of a knowledge base rather like Wikipedia, or better yet Linus’s Law, formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his essay and book The Cathedral and the Bazaar. (1999).[1][2]  Say hello again to Wikipedia:

	The law states that ‘given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow’; or more 		formally: ‘Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost 	every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to 		someone.’  Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of 	reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software 		reviewing. 

If Git did the same for art as it does for code, all we’d see would be social realism.  Hopefully we don’t all want to meet a consensus in art
Thank knot for that.
But seems to be the state contemporary art finds itself in today—a loop of representation that is bracketed between known histories and the internet of things.  When effects are easy, where is content?


Briefly then, I can speak to my practice.
I believe the experience of contemporary images has entirely shifted from 

I want to change the way we experience contemporary images.  To this end, I have adopted two models.  First, a purely conceptual form, the loop; and second, its practical manifestation and everyday tangle we all know as a knot.  I don’t believe a pure loop can persist in the natural world—it inevitably becomes entangled, both with itself and the linear processes upon its path.  The networked experience of contemporary media and the crisis of digital images is exactly as such—the copy set free from it’s original—a discursive loop with a half-life circulation.

Memory on the other hand employs the loop as a constructive tool.  Say you have a song repeating in your head—it’s skipping like a record—but the full sequence is broken.  The loop of memory is what enables you to fall into the song’s general rhythm and reconstruct patterns with mere fragments.  To me, this nonlinear recursion makes memory—and thought as a whole—more like disentangling a knot than a mechanical parallelism of time.  

My practice is bifurcated between these two species of thought, both pure loop and practical knot, but each process employs an algorithmic approach in generating form.  I've been making my own analog knots—or rather using the tide cycles of the Thames to draw.  The river’s steady ebb and flow is itself a natural loop—a pure sine in lunar time—and I've adopted its function much like an algorithmic script crunching data.  If coding s the compression of possibility, I take the knot as the critical foundation of contemporary visuality. 

Case in point: the internet is one giant knot.  Moreover, the internet is a giant readymade.  My vision is entirely distinct from my historicization; Duchamp’s readymades mark the introduction of the loop into the mirror of symbolic representation.  And practically speaking, programmers employ scripts as readymade tools underneath the surface gloss of image media, take prebuilt software as given.  Piecewise frameworks and archived libraries abstract the essential 1’s and 0’s so that development can be focused at the intersection and interpretation of their symbolic containers. 

My digital work employs the looping mechanism to tie knots in time.  In video and animated GIFs I am reorganizing frames algorithmically, working at the upper threshold of screen refresh rates to entangle the singular image with networked possible futures.  Ultimately the loop is a question, “what if?” while disentangling its knots revels in pure pursuit.

From a looping stream of operational logic, flexible frameworks may appear counterintuitive to optimization, but they are in fact the generative structures that harness flow and link connective nodes.


Or more acutely, our multimedia digital experience is the circulation of nested scripts—executables that fashion the point and click environment through these nodes.  ‘Loop the loop’ ad infinitum enables the shared hyperlink experience.  Call and response functionality turns iterative tasks into software, but the combinatorial effect means we can all customize our own corner of the universe under the same frontend assembly.  So basically, the internet is a giant readymade.  










To bring it back to 


Pixel palettes and words alike have long been spilt over plug-in tools, that is to say the general wash of rendered effects saturating content.  Which is not too far off from the traditional brush, this loop of representation—we render the world that immanently surrounds us.  The difference is that effects are easy, almost so easy that their employ becomes interchangeable, not to mention excessive.

Hito Steyerl speaks In Defense of the Poor Image, the inevitable decay 

	The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution 			substandard. As it accelerates, it deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a 		preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, 	squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, 	remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution. p32

“Its genealogy is dubious.” p32 In other words
“The bruises of images are its glitches and artifacts, the traces of its rips and transfers.” p 27

“swarm circulation” p44
and claims in Benjaminian terms, “This aura is no longer based on the permanence of the ‘original,’ but on the transience of the copy.” p42
