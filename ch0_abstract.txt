Looop City

Abstract:
	Where does the loop begin?  Like an image without a caption, the loop is a story that has forgotten its own history in order to overwrite the present.  It carries the momentum of innocent wonder—“what if?”—but how does that recursive inquiry accumulate knowledge and complexity in time?  How does it grow—or does it grow at all?  This text introduces the knot as a material inevitability.  Born of post-Duchampian artistic practice and 21st century virtual environments, the knot offers a functional model to distinguish the purely conceptual parameters active in both analog and digital loops.  Put simply, I don’t believe the loop can persist in the natural world—it inevitably becomes entangled with linear processes.  Rather than speculate “what if,” it is the knot that poses the question “how?”—in such a way that turns conceptual frameworks into material form.  
	Caught at the intersection of coding and creativity, this text invokes the readymade in order to realign algorithmic meta-programming with artistic practice.  I will trace three distinct narratives, first marking the Duchampian inheritance in order to separate conceptual loop from contemporary knot.  Anchoring a root as vast as representational art is a bit of a tricky historicization, but giving the loop a visual foundation will then help clarify the state of the knot’s present day media-agnosticism.  While the loop is most often celebrated as a musical device, I will rely on audio cues to inform connections between melodic composition and scripted engineering.
	The text itself is written an active investigation of the structures that modify and recapitulate the virtual loop—namely, version control software.  With each edited version, I will push revisions to a GitHub repository, along each chapter’s appropriate timeline.  You can follow me under the username “loopcity” at https://github.com/loopcity/loopcity/.  Not only will my writing process be fully traceable, but Git allows me to see how irregular loops intersect side-by-side, and at any given moment merge versions or revert back down to the master branch.  Like a knot, a timeline of the branching tree is visible at: https://github.com/loopcity/loopcity/network.  In the end, I will be able to compile the writer’s loop of nonlinear editing and generate a versioned knot document alongside the formal text.  While the loop insistently demands to know—“what if?”—disentangling its sympathetic knots revels in the pure pursuit.
