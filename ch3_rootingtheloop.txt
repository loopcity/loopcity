3.  Rooting the Loop:  A History

Who invented the loop?  It would be hard to discuss the loop in representational art without discussing the resurrection of Christ.  


It is however 

Discoguy interviewing Tom Moulton, an early disco producer who ‘accidentally’ discovered the breakbeat.

Break and breakbeat

	I got a record for Scepter Records, it was called 'Dreamworld' by Don 		Downing. That was the very first record I ever went into mix. It immaculated! 	[Immaculation is when the key goes up.]  Alright, so in the second part of the 	record, towards the end of the record it immaculated to another key. So what 	happened is I went to make a long version of it and of course I want to get 		back to the beginning of the song and of course the key drops down. And I 	went; 'Oh, this is horrible! So what am I gonna do?' I said; 'Like I feel that I 		can do, is take out everything that's musical.' So that how it went into a drum 	break. Then, I would start putting in percussion back in, then I would bring the 	bass. So in the long version the song actually sounds like it's immaculate 		twice, but it only does once. But that's how it was created.

When telling me of the "accident" of inventing the 12" single, Tom asked me if I know 
how he came to create the famous Disco "Break".

Meco Monardo :  “It was nice to hear the song for a minute or so, but then if you just hear the music and then you could imagine the song in your mind. That's a very very powerful thing.”
