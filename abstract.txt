Abstract:

What is a loop?  
And when does the given structure of a simple looping repetition become a complex knot?
In this text I will claim that the knot is an inevitability, both of post-Duchampian artistic practice and of 21st century virtual environments.
I will analyze what I find to be purely conceptual parameters active in the loop,
yet suggest that its material resolution grows in the form of a knot.

Notions of in time and space.
Held at the intersection of coding and creativity, this paper will 
use the readymade 
situate meta-programming against artistic practice.

My argument will follow from 3 distinct narratives.
I will first mark the Duchampian inheritance
and disentangle conceptual loop from contemporary knot, 
before then historicizing the loop ’s symbolic mirror of the in the face of the knot’s media-agnosticism.
